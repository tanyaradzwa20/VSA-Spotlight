        <h2>Brief Introduction</h2>
        <p>My name is Anne (with an E), I have been in the South African higher education
           system for about 7 years now. I started my undergraduate journey in South Africa 
           in 2013 and continued up until Masters level. The purpose of this blog series
           will be to impart some of my knowledge, which I think will be beneficial for
           anyone that wants to pursue studies in South Africa. Being an international 
           student is not easy and can be so overwhelming! From the application process, 
           hassles of attaining a study visa, the finance issues, the culture and language 
           barriers! Wow, it’s A LOT! Lucky for you, the purpose of this blog is to share 
           some of my vast knowledge through my own stories and those from other people.
           Therefore, if decide you to study in South Africa you will know exactly what 
           you getting yourself into (see, I got you!). In this edition I will start off
           with very general information and as the weeks proceed, I will deal with more 
           specific issues.</p>
        <p>For this first post, I will get into reasons to choose to study in South Africa.
           I will discuss the university rankings, the geographical distribution and the
           type of programs offered at the four top universities in the country.
           I hope you will enjoy it!</p>
        <p>South Africa is known to most African people as the land of “greener pastures.”
           Africans have migrated to South Africa in search of a better life than the one 
           that can be afforded in their home countries. As an African, South Africa is an 
           attractive choice of study because four of the country’s universities are ranked 
           top in the continent. This is according to the Times Higher Education university 
           rankings which rates university performance using indicators such as research, 
           research output, innovation, international outlook and teaching. South Africa 
           leads with 3 (University of Cape Town, Witwatersrand and Stellenbosch and 
           University of KwaZulu-Natal) in the top four.</p>
