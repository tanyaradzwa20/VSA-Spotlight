        <p>I just started a post-doctoral fellowship at the UK Dementia Research
           institute (The University of I’ve always loved STEM, but there were
           a few stellar individuals, teachers, and professors that encouraged
           me to pursue a STEM career. 
        </p>
        <p>Dr Mae Jemison was one of the early players; my little mind was blown
           when I saw her photo for the first time. I thought, someone like me 
           has been to space! My teachers in primary and secondary school, though
           too many to list out by name, were also inspirational.

        <p>Dr Peter Bolton, my first-year biology professor from Richmond:
           the American International University in London, made learning 
           about the human body thrilling, and Dr Paul Lipton, my Neuroscience 
           101 professor after I transferred to BU, opened my eyes to the
           universe of the brain and I’ve been in pursuit of learning

        <h2>What is the biggest challenge/barrier you have faced as an African in STEM?</h2>
        <p>A general lack of representation – in the 4years I was at UBC, I cannot recall
           meeting a single person in my program who was also black/African. It sucked. 
           In my lab, there was one other Black girl (though she was in a different program);
           when she left, I very quickly felt tokenised.

        <h2>How do you think your background/upbringing has been beneficial in your journey/career?</h2>
        <p>My background has afforded me a vantage point that my peers don’t always have. 
           I think about how our work – which is likely to have clinical implications – affects 
           everyone, not just the affluent and the privileged (who often have better access to
           healthcare), but also individuals who may not have easy access to healthcare, or 
           trust the healthcare system for valid reasons.

         <p>I also like the instant camaraderie that comes out of meeting someone who 
            looks like me (or even remotely like me!) in any social or professional setting.

        <p>Visibility is key here! Though we make up a smaller proportion of individuals in STEM,
           the ones that do exist need to be more well known.

        <p>I always say, a whole generation of children dreamed of becoming astronauts only after
           we made it to the moon. Sometimes you need to see your face represented in spaces in

                  <h2>How do you think we can start to change the narrative surrounding African contributions 
                      to global STEM research & careers?
                  </h2>
                  <p>I always say, a whole generation of children dreamed of becoming astronauts only after
                    we made it to the moon. Sometimes you need to see your face represented in spaces in 
                    order to dream about the possibility of entering those spaces.
                    
                  </p> 
                  <p>  Visibility is key here! Though we make up a smaller proportion of individuals in STEM,
                    the ones that do exist need to be more well known.
